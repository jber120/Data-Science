# Data-Science

The first project was for Introduction to Data Science at Western Governor's University (WGU). We were tasked with investigating a data set of our choice, we used Python and a Jupyter notebook to document our findings.

The second course that was part of the Udacity nano-degree was Data Visualization using Tableau. The following link can be used to view a Tableau Story that I created to explore the relationship between height, weight, and hand dominance with average home runs and average batting average. https://public.tableau.com/views/Baseball_Project_Post_Feedback/BaseballDataVisualization?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link

Also attached is my resume, which highlights the skills I've developed and tools that I've used in my coursework at WGU in addition to my career as an educator.
