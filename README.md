# Data-Science

The first project was for Introduction to Data Science at Western Governor's University. We were tasked with investigating a data set of our choice, we used Python and a Jupyter notebook to document our findings.

The second course that was part of the Udacity nano-degree was Data Visualization using Tableau. The following link can be used to view a Tableau Story that I created to explore the relationship between height, weight, and hand dominance with average home runs and average batting average. https://public.tableau.com/views/Baseball_Project_Post_Feedback/BaseballDataVisualization?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link

The C++ project is unrelated to the Data Science project portfolio developed for Western Governors University, but demonstrates my ability to learn and apply a variety of programming langauges.
