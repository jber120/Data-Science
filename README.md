# Data-Science

The first project was for Introduction to Data Science at Western Governor's University (WGU). We were tasked with investigating a data set of our choice, we used Python and a Jupyter notebook to document our findings.

The second course that was part of the Udacity nano-degree was Data Visualization using Tableau. The following link can be used to view a Tableau Story that I created to explore the relationship between height, weight, and hand dominance with average home runs and average batting average. 

My final capstone was centered on the quesiton of how data science could potetially provide insight into how to optimize bugets for New York City Public Schoools bus system based on breakdown and delay data. Above are the Jupyter Notebook used for clearning, analyzing, and building machine learning models. Please ask if you'd like an overview of my learning from this task, as there were a lot of takeaways that extend far beyond the final answer of "New York City's Traffic is the biggest problem".

Also attached is my resume, which highlights the skills I've developed and tools that I've used in my coursework at WGU in addition to my career as an educator.
